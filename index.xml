A multi-tap delay plugin featuring creative, musical, and organically-inspired algorithms to produce 12 unique delay timings.

Features:
• 12-tap delay matrix with individual control over each tap
• 8 unique timing algorithms inspired by nature, music theory, and mathematics  
• Per-tap volume and pan controls with visual envelope editing
• Intuitive grid-based interface

Algorithms:
• Seed Random - Generates unpredictable, organic delay patterns
• Quantum Shuffle - Timing variations based on quantum probability concepts
• Perlin Noise - Smooth, natural variations using noise algorithms
• Spiral Wave - Creates spiraling, evolving delay patterns
• Chromatic - Delays based on chromatic scale intervals
• Harmonic - Musically-consonant delays following harmonic series
• Fibonacci - Nature-inspired timing using the golden ratio
• L-System - Fractal-based patterns for complex rhythms (used to model plant growth)

A timing measurement plugin for REAPER that helps you set delays and time-based effects "by hand" using your mouse or keyboard.

Features:
• Measures intervals between clicks with millisecond accuracy
• Real-time conversion to Hz, ms, and samples at current sample rate
• Tempo-aware beat division calculations  
• Audio click feedback for rhythmic accuracy
• History tracking of recent measurements

Use Cases:
• Setting delay times by tapping along with music
• Finding the tempo of audio material
• Calculating LFO rates and modulation speeds
• Measuring rhythmic intervals for precise timing
