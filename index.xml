        <description><![CDATA[
A multi-tap delay plugin featuring creative, musical, and organically-inspired algorithms to produce 12 unique delay timings.

Features:
- 12-tap delay matrix with individual control over each tap
- 8 unique timing algorithms inspired by nature, music theory, and mathematics
- Per-tap volume and pan controls with visual envelope editing
- Intuitive grid-based interface

Algorithms:
- Seed Random: Generates unpredictable, organic delay patterns
- Quantum Shuffle: Timing variations based on quantum probability concepts
- Perlin Noise: Smooth, natural variations using noise algorithms
- Spiral Wave: Creates spiraling, evolving delay patterns
- Chromatic: Delays based on chromatic scale intervals
- Harmonic: Musically-consonant delays following harmonic series
- Fibonacci: Nature-inspired timing using the golden ratio
- L-System: Fractal-based patterns for complex rhythms (inspired by plant growth)

A precision timing measurement plugin for REAPER that helps you set delays and time-based effects.

Features:
- Measures intervals between clicks with millisecond accuracy
- Real-time conversion to Hz, ms, and samples at current sample rate
- Tempo-aware beat division calculations
- Audio click feedback for rhythmic accuracy
- History tracking of recent measurements
- MIDI input mode for sample-accurate timing
- Mouse input mode for quick measurements

Use Cases:
- Setting delay times by tapping along with music
- Finding the tempo of audio material
- Calculating LFO rates and modulation speeds
- Measuring rhythmic intervals for precise timing
