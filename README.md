Seed Delay [UNSTABLE BUT USABLE]
multi-tap delay 
per tap volume, filtering and panning 
flexible and synced timing with host tempo
creative algorithms to generate unexpected delay timings

Tap Timing Utility [I USE THIS ONE ALL THE TIME] 
kinda like have a met right there. you can click on it to measure your timing. Then displays the tempo of your click in relevant conversions. Beat, ms, Hz, Samples@SampleRate

Super Panner [FAILED EXPERIMENT]
Binaural panning but adding useful and convenient functions/setting. 
-sound source swirling around you. 
-randomly swimming around you. 
Want to be able to change the rate, sync to the beat, and dial in the perceived width.
My only reason to make this was to speed up my process. 

Quantum Distance  [FAILED EXPERIMENT]
Emulation of creating distance between the listener and sound source(does it sound near or far?). I was thinking about how to put a twist on this idea that would be unexpected- The hope is to be able to hear what it would sound like if something was approaching you from another dimension.
